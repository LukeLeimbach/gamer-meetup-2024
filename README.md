# Itinerary for Gamer Meetup 2024

What's up frankers???? In this document, I will lay out all the important info about what's going down in Colorado. DM me if I miss something and I will update this form.

## Expectations (READ FULLY)
This is the most important part of the whole trip which is why it's at the top of this list. The barn does not belong to me, it's my parents. They are very generous to let us come hang out at there for the week. With that being said, the only reason that they are letting us host another gamer meetup in the barn is because of the respect and graciousness shown by Tyler, Noah, and Conner during Gamer Meetup 2022. It's an amazing space that I'm blessed to share with you all, and I ask that you all treat my home, family, and property with the utmost respect. Many of you have not been to the barn yet, and I ask you, for the sake of your dignity and future Gamer Meetups, that you are tidy, polite, and extremely respectful.

When hanging with each other, remember that this is not Fortnite. Act like adults. We traveled across the whole country to spend time with each other for one week, so do not start beef or be rude to your friends. We all joke about killing Noah, but actually killing him is crossing the line (cuz I want to do it personally).

At the meetup, as is customary, there will be weed, alcohol, and nicotine. If you start acting out of pocket on a substance (ie. you start talking serious shit, you break stuff, you make an outrageous mess, you try to do something illegal), **you will be cut off for the day**. The extent of the cut-off will be determined by the group. If you get cut off, don't pout or get mad, it's not a punishment, it's your friends coming together to helping you be a better man. Consume like an adult. Sip your beer. Have a few puffs. Don't be retarded.

By coming to the barn, **you agree to**:
- Treat your friends, my family, and my shit with the utmost respect.
- Behave like an adult.
- Consume like an adult.
- Clean up your messes.
- Be accountable.
- Not be a downer.

**If you do not abide by what you've agreed to, you are not welcome to stay at the barn and will be driven to the airport.**

## Living Arrangements

### Description
My property has a house, a cabin, and a barn. We will be staying in the barn. The term 'barn' is more of a funny name, it's basically a big hangout spot.

### Sleeping locations:
Beds will be first-come-first-serve, so **kill** upon arrival to secure your spot. **Jerico gets first dibs cuz he's coming early to help set up**.

Available are:
- 3 beds (one with complimentary cum stains on it)
- 2 couches (can fit 3 people total)
- 1 queen bed (can fit all of us ;) )
- A big ass carpeted floor

### Pillows and blankets
I should have plenty to go around, but if you're geekin, bring your own.

### Bathroom and shower
There is one bathroom with a shower. Due to the incident last year, shitting in the shower (serious).

### Cooking
We have a full sized kitchen and an outdoor grill attached to the patio. During previous gamer meetups, we've cooked breakfast and dinner almost every day.

### Entertainment
The barn is sick. Here's what we've got to monkey with:
- Indoor basketball court
- Poker table
- Pool table
- TVs (to watch Mr. Balling 24/7)
- Pickle ball court
- Outdoor patio with fireplace
- Bears
- Hot tub


## Planned outings
WIP - plan at least 6 trips + financial cost

### Possibilities (up for discussion)
- Drive to Mt. Evans and hang out on the mountain
- Go camping
- Go fishing
- Go on a hike
- Hang out at Evergreen Lake
- Go down to Denver to do something
- Golfing / Putt putt golf
- Escape room

On days that we don't have anything planned, we will probably fuck around at the crib.
